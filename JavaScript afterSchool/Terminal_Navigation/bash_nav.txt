You can use the Tab key after pressing the first few characters (this will then "fill in" the rest of the folder for you e.g. type cd ~/LTab fills in cd ~/Library/ then type ApTab and it will fill in the rest for you.

If there is a space between words and you don't want to use the methods above, put a \ (backslash) before the space, e.g. cd ~/Library/Application\ Support.
